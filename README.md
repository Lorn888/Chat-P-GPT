# Patryks Chat-GPT

## Overview

This project is a web application that demonstrates how to integrate JavaScript AI into a web app. It features an elegant user interface that resembles the ChatGPT app and allows users to communicate with GPT-3 models via API. With this project, I was able to explore the capabilities of JavaScript AI and create a powerful, user-friendly application that can be integrated into any web app. Whether you're a developer looking to expand your skills or a business owner looking to enhance your web presence, this project provides a valuable example of how to integrate AI into your web app. Through this project, I learned how to work with AI models, communicate with APIs, and create a seamless user experience. I believe this project will be of interest to anyone interested in AI and web development, and I'm excited to share it with the community.

## Technology Used

This project was developed using vanilla JavaScript and was set up using Vite.
For the server side, I used Node.js and for the layout, I utilized CSS. I handled events in the application with JavaScript and was able to render markdown from strings.

To access ChatGPT3 API it is neceserry to register an account at https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference to generate a unique API key. They are typically used to identify and authorize access to an API's resources. They allow the API provider to track and control how their services are being used, and to limit access to authorized users or applications.

This project required a solid understanding of JavaScript and the ability to use Node.js to create a server and handle data. Additionally, knowledge of CSS was required to create an elegant and user-friendly layout. By using these technologies together, I was able to create an application that is fast, responsive, and easy to use.

## Potential Applications

The potential applications of AI are endless, which is why it is rapidly gaining prominence across industries. This project is just one example of how AI can be integrated into web apps to enhance the user experience and provide value to users. By leveraging the power of AI, businesses can automate tasks, improve efficiency, and create a more seamless user experience.

## Features

In this project, I utilized a loader animation of three dots to indicate that the AI is processing the request. This provides feedback to the user and enhances the user experience by giving the impression that the application is working on the user's request. Additionally, I implemented a feature where the response is generated gradually letter by letter, similar to how it works in the ChatGPT application. This creates a more natural conversation flow and makes the user feel like they are chatting with a real person, enhancing the overall user experience.

To further improve the user experience, I also included a cat GIF as a fun and playful element in the application. This helps to create a friendly and welcoming atmosphere that encourages users to engage with the application. By incorporating these elements into the project, I was able to create an application that is both functional and enjoyable to use.
